# Operators
A basic cpp code while describing swapping

## Theory: 
- Different operators in C++.
- The different operators that we used are :
- addition: '+',
- subtraction: '-',
- multiplication: '*',
- division: '/',
- modulus: '%',
- less than:'<',
- greater than: '>',
- less than equal to:'<=',
- greater than equal to: '>=',
- bitwise: '&',
- and: '&&',
- or: '||'.

- These are the different opertiors that can be used as arithmetic operators, assignment operators, bitwise operators,and many more.

### Arithmetic operators:
- These operators are used to perform arithmetic or mathematical operations on the operands. For example, ‘+’ is used for addition, ‘-‘ is used for subtraction ‘*’ is used for 
  multiplication, etc.
- Arithmetic Operators can be classified into 2 Types:
- A) Unary Operators.
- B) Binary Operators.

### Assignment operators:
- These operators are used to assign value to a variable.
- The left side operand of the assignment operator is a variable and the right side operand of the assignment operator is a value.
- The value on the right side must be of the same data type as the variable on the left side otherwise the compiler will raise an error.

### Bitwise operators:
- These operators are used to perform bit-level operations on the operands.
- The operators are first converted to bit-level and then the calculation is performed on the operands.
- Mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.
- Can be performed at the bit level for faster processing.
- Types:
- XOR,OR,AND,Left shift,Right shift,One's complement.

### Algorithm:

- Start => define variables for each operator => assign operation to each variable => print output of all the variables => End

### Explanation of the algorithm: 
- First we include the header file.
- Then we define different variables for different operators.
- We assign different operations to different variables.
- Then we print the outputs of all the varibles.
