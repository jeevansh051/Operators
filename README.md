# Swapping
A basic cpp code while describing swapping

## Theory: 
- Different operators in C++.
- The different operators that we used are :
- addition: '+',
- subtraction: '-',
- multiplication: '*',
- division: '/',
- modulus: '%',
- less than:'<',
- greater than: '>',
- less than equal to:'<=',
- greater than equal to: '>=',
- bitwise: '&',
- and: '&&',
- or: '||'.

- These are the different opertiors that can be used as arithmetic operators, assignment operators, bitwise operators.

### Algorithm:

- Start => define variables for each operator => assign operation to each variable => print output of all the variables => End

### Explanation of the algorithm: 
- First we include the header file.
- Then we define different variables for different operators.
- We assign different operations to different variables.
- Then we print the outputs of all the varibles.
